## Compiling and Running Java Programs
Note that since the shape classes are separate classes, you will need to compile ALL the files (at least one time).  You can do this by running
```
javac *.java
```
The star means to compile every file that is a Java file type.

Run your code by running
```
java Main.java
```

After you compile the shape classes, you only need to compile and run `Main.java` as usual.

# Instructions  

## The assignment

Your job in this assignment is to write a program that takes a message as a string and reduces the number of characters it uses in two different set ways. The first thing your program will do is ask the user to type a message which will be stored as a String. The String entered should be immediately converted to lowercase as this will make processing much easier. You will then apply two different algorithms to shorten the data contained within the String.

## Algorithm 1
This algorithm creates a string from the message in which every vowel (a, e, i, o, and u) is removed unless the vowel is at the very start of a word (i.e., it is preceded by a space or is the first letter of the message). Every repeated non-vowel character is also removed from the new string (i.e., if a character appears several times in a row it should only appear once at that location). So for example the string "I will arrive in Mississippi really soon" becomes "i wl arv in mssp rly sn".

After applying this algorithm, your program should output the shortened message, the number of vowels removed, the number of repeated non-vowel characters removed, and how much shorter the shortened message is than the original message. The exact format in which the program should print this information is shown in the sample runs.

Hints and Pseudocode
* To remove characters, create a new String, and initialize it to the empty String
* Add the characters that are valid ("are good").
* A vowel is repeated if it is the same as the character behind it (or is the same as the character in front of it, depending on how your brain works).
* Notice that, no matter what, you are always adding the first character of the sentence.

## Algorithm 2

This algorithm creates a string by taking each unique character in the message in the order they first appear and putting that letter and the number of times it appears in the original message into the shortened string. Your algorithm should ignore any spaces in the message, and any characters which it has already put into the shortened string. For example, the string "I will arrive in Mississippi really soon" becomes "8i1w4l2a3r1v2e2n1m5s2p1y2o".

After applying this algorithm, your program should output the shortened message, the number of different characters appearing, and how much shorter the shortened message is than the original message. The exact format in which the program should print this information is shown in the sample runs.

Hints and Pseudocode:
* Create a new string, and initialize it to the empty String.
* A character is unique if it is not already in your new String (indexOf will help you here).
* You'll need to use nested loops here: the outer loop will keep track of the current letter; the inner loop will count how many of that letter appears in the sentence

## Milestones
As you work on this assignment, you can use the milestones below to inform your development process:

1. **Milestone 1:** Set up a program that takes a string input and converts all the letters to lowercase. Start implementing algorithm 1: create a counter variable and iterate through the characters of the String, incrementing this each time a vowel is encountered which is not preceded by a space or is at the start of the String. So at the end of the loop this counts the number of vowels that are not at the start of a word.
2. **Milestone 2:** Add further conditions (using else if) in your loop to count any non-vowel characters which appear immediately after the same character. Make a new empty String to hold the shortened message at the start of the code, then add a final else condition in the loop to add all characters which were not vowels or repeated letters to this String.  Then print the statements for algorithm 1 using your counts and shortened message.
3. **Milestone 3:** Start implementing algorithm 2 by writing code that iterates through the String and checks that each character is not a space and has not already appeared in the String before that point. You will need to use nested loops - an outer loop to iterate through the String characters and an inner loop that looks through the previous characters up to that point - and a flag variable to record if a letter was found in the inner loop. Use a counter variable to count all such "unique" characters in the String.
4. **Milestone 4:** Add a second inner loop inside the outer loop from the previous which counts all appearances of a character that passes the tests from milestone 3. Add the character and the number of times it appears to another shortened message String (which should start as blank String). Finally, print the statements for algorithm 2 using your unique character count and shortened message.

  {
   repeat_rem++;	// Remove duplicate by not adding it, and increment duplicate counter
  }
  else	// Otherwise, the letter is good, and we add it
  {
   output += letter;
